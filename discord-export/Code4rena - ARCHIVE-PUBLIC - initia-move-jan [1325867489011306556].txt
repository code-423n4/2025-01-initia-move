ℹ️ Wardens, FYI we've added @Harvey to the list of sponsor team members to tag in private threads if you have questions about the codebase.

@beer-1  @Leo.init  @ALPAC4   how can I get  ``initiad `` to use it like ``aptos move test`` to run tests for move ?


[01/10/2025 02:54] ox1nteger
Hello, you can use like `initiad move test`. it's almost same with aptos one.


[01/10/2025 08:23] uaarrr
How can I get ``initiad`` cli tool exactly ? I found a initia docs with step by step but it doesnt work for me to git clone and make install


[01/10/2025 08:42] 0xluk3

@Harvey  can you make sure usernames modules test are working ??


[01/14/2025 02:59] ox1nteger
Are you referring to the test code within the module? By any chance, is there a test case that’s failing? cc @ALPAC4

Hello. Since this is my first time working with a blockchain protocol that is not EVM, I'm not quite sure how it works. Could you please explain how users can use the username-module and vip-module?

❗Wardens - please note that we have noticed an error in the awarding of Initia Move. There was one submission that should have been marked `out of scope` as a known issue.  We will get this adjusted shortly.

In the meantime we have deleted the awarding post here and in #📢・c4-updates.  We’ll get a new/updated award announcement posted as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience and understanding.
